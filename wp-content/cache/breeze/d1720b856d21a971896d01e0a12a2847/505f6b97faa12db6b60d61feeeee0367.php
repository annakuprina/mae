										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">From the trigger being depressed through to the ear-splitting crack of a gunshot, (certainly more noticeable on a range however than in the bush) hearing loss is inescapable and for the ear, an irreparable problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">From the moment the firing pin / striker impacts the primer to the igniting powder sending the projectile on its journey up the bore there is a pressure wave forming in front of the projectile. This is known as the precursor wave or bow wave. This is created by the accelerating projectile displacing the air forward of the projectile in the bore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the pressure in the chamber intensifies, another pressure wave is being formed by the burning propellant. This pressure wave is gaining velocity at approximately <em>2-3 times faster than the terminal velocity of the projectile</em>.<br />
Once the projectile leaves the bore the high pressure gas behind the projectile, which is known as the blast wave is released.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the release of this wave that creates the ear-splitting sound of the gun shot, and it is the effect of this secondary pressure wave that moderators are designed to mitigate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">Muzzle Brakes (MB) are devices designed to reduce recoil and muzzle jump, that attach to the muzzle thread of a rifle barrel.<br />
Although there are various designs, with an arrangement of holes and slots of various geometrical shapes, some designs prove to be very effective whilst others are less so. The energy released as the projectile exits the rifle barrel travels adjacent to the direction of the projectile. This energy is then directed through the various geometrically-designed cavities and drives against the exposed faces of the MB (surface friction) which results in a percentage of recoil reduction.<br />
The greater the surface area of these cavities machined at the correct angles, the more effective the MB. The result is greater recoil reduction with a dramatic increase in the Sound Pressure Level (SPL).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p style="text-align: justify;">MB’s with an array of small holes arranged longitudinally (whether in a helical, staggered or straight formation) can create a reverse effect derived from particle compression, which creates less surface friction to that of the MB. As a result, recoil reduction is not effective and the SPL is not too different from that generated by a standard firearm without an MB.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the use of an effective MB, the SPL can reach as high as 20dB. This may not seem much of an increase, but taking into account that for every 3dB increase there is a doubling of sound pressure, the exponential result is nearly 7x the increase of the SPL.<br />
This is the main reason why MB’s are discouraged at shooting ranges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recoil reduction can be very effective with the use of a correctly-designed MB. However, there are important consequences that a well-designed MB cannot mitigate, even with using ear muffs or ear plugs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1: <strong>Concussion:</strong> From the released pressure wave, affecting spotters, other range shooters, hunting dogs etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2: <strong>Dust signature:</strong> Created as the released energy comes into contact with surrounding terrain such as sand or dust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3:<strong> Increased SPL:</strong> Affecting neighbouring properties in close proximity to shooting ranges, horses, farm animals, dogs etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4: <strong>Shooters Flinching: </strong>From anticipation of the shot, resulting in missed targets, lost or wounded game.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sound moderators/ suppressors work in exactly the same way but with the obvious sound reduction features. A moderator / suppressor that has very good sound reduction will generally have good recoil reduction as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a common mistake whilst shooting over or around dogs that it is assumed the hunting dog is not subject to risk of hearing loss like humans. However, this is not the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dog&#8217;s hearing is more acute and works over a wider range of frequencies than a human&#8217;s, therefore its potential for permanent hearing damage is no different from ours.<br />
Dogs cannot communicate this to us other than by their actions or the absence thereof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Humans can choose to take measures to help protect their hearing, however it is not possible, neither is it practical, to place hearing protection devices onto dogs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">
<p>It is our responsibility as dog owners, hunters / shooters to ensure that our pets are not subjected to this punishment. Sound moderators provide the solution to reduce hearing loss, for hunters and their dogs.</p>
<p>Sound moderators remove the blast pressure wave which is the cause of hearing loss, allowing the dog to focus on the impact noise of the projectile.<br />
This allows the dog to effect faster acquisition of the target species, and reduces the chances for game to be lost or wounded.</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">Moderators are attached to the firearm and act directly on the Sound Pressure Level created during firing.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Moderators have integral muzzle brakes which remove a high percentage of the felt recoil. The weight of a moderator also plays an important part with recoil reduction. Extra weight can be advantageous. Too light can result in next to no recoil reduction on heavier recoiling calibres, which will allow harmonic/ vibration transfer through the body.<br />
A moderator also minimises the chances of the hunter flinching which is one of the main reasons for lost or wounded game.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Moderators allow the shooter or hunter to clearly hear as well as being aware of what is happening around them and under-foot.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Moderators stop “muzzle jump” which allows a hunter taking long shots to determine where the projectile will land and to allow for calculated shot placement, thus reducing the chance of lost or wounded game.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Moderators reduce the risk of unwanted attention from neighbouring property owners whilst shooting e.g. farm or range.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Moderators reduce stress and the risk of hearing injury whilst shooting over dogs or around livestock.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph" style="text-align: justify;">The internal workings of the MAE centre-fire moderators are permanently sealed and do not require disassembly for cleaning. The sealed units prevent incorrect disassembly and assembly of the components which can lead to misalignment causing bullet-strike, and accuracy problems. We choose to craft all our centre-fire products using <strong>100% 304L stainless steel</strong>. The reason being is that our centre-fire range of moderators caters for a wide variety of calibres, and we wish to ensure all our valued customers are provided with a durable product. Our entire centre-fire rifle range of moderators does not incorporate dissimilar materials e.g. aluminium and stainless steel.<br />
Moderators are in essence pressure vessels. They are similar to boilers, but on a smaller scale, dealing with the high pressure gases produced from a gunshot. In our experience, manufacturing moderators using both aluminium for reduced weight and stainless steel internal components to deal with the harsh exposure to combusting powder, creates multiple problems.<br />
It is generally accepted that all oxide-protected metals that have contact with dissimilar metals, especially in moist environments, should be avoided.</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p style="text-align: justify;">1: Galvanic Corrosion: Using aluminium and stainless steel together creates a galvanic reaction, similar to what occurs to make a wet battery work. This is a chemical reaction between two dissimilar metals. Metals have a galvanic rating which is a guideline in the combining of materials in manufacturing. The more positive the numbers for the relative metal the more noble the metal. The more noble the metal the more resistant it is to Galvanic Corrosion. Therefore putting aluminium and stainless steel together creates this reaction which compromises the structural integrity of the less noble metal, in this case the aluminium. To further prevent this reaction the aluminium components must be anodised or similarly treated to create a boundary layer between the two metals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2: Thermal Expansion: When metals are subjected to heat e.g. gun shots, thermal expansion of the two dissimilar metals leads to the components with a slower thermal expansion rate to become loose in the assembly.  This allows the high pressure gases from the combustion to force residue into the gaps between the components created by this expansion. As the moderator cools, the exterior aluminium tube contracts and traps the residue which has lodged between the tube and the internals. For this reason, aluminium moderators must be able to be disassembled to allow access cleaning the internal components and removal of this residue. Either the front or rear caps, or both, must be unscrewed to gain access. The unscrewing of these caps and the removal of the internals, combined with the residue, eventually wears through the thin anodised layer on both the exterior tube thread and the end cap threads compromising the corrosive resistant properties of the aluminium and accelerating the galvanic reaction. With 100% 304L stainless steel, the expansion rate of the components is uniform thereby reducing the possibility of parts coming loose. As there are no dissimilar materials a galvanic reaction is obviated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3: Flame-Cutting:  In our experience we have found that unlike aluminium, 304L stainless steel has good flame-cutting resistance. Flame-cutting results from the high temperature and high pressure generated from the burning propellant. We have found that flame-cutting will erode the inside of the aluminium tube directly where the high pressure gases are exiting the muzzle of the rifle barrel. Such erosion greatly reduces the life of the aluminium.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4: Bullet Strike: Over the years we have refined our products to ensure safety to the firearm operator, as well as to the bystander, in the event of bullet-strike inside the moderator. This does occur, albeit infrequently, and it is a very real problem. We have been improving our moderator design to mitigate its consequences, in the event of a bullet strike. The machined internal components are designed to collapse and to project the flight of the bullet out the front of the moderator. The baffles forward of the blast baffle are made of lighter gauge stainless steel material than the exterior tubing therefore they present less resistance to the erratic flight of a bullet which has experienced a strike within the moderator. This is to ensure that the projectile does not compromise the exterior shell of the moderator and place the operator or bystander at risk. Refer to articles to read and view images relating to products which have encountered bullet strike.</p>
